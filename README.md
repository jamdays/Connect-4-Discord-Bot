# Connect-4-Discord-Bot
this is a discord bot I made that facilitates connect four games between discord users
It can also play othello and mancala, but mancala isn't very good because it is just numbers. 
It only can have one instance of each game at a time. For example, only one game of connect 4 will exist at a time. 
!help for help-- but this is the message it will display.
CONNECT 4
!reset- reset board
!board - display board
!play col - play the col specified (1-7)
MANCALA
!Mplay spot - play the beads in specified spot on your side (1-6)
!Mreset - reset mancala board
OTHELLO
!O new - start a new game of othello
!O play row, col - play piece (if legal) at specified row and column (0,0 - 7,7)
!O save game- save the game (the bot will send a message containing the save)
!O continue [save] - [save] is the game ID that the bot sent after using the save game command
FILLER
!Filler - for instructions

!Filler will display:
Welcome to Filler,
The object of the game is to capture as many squares as possible
you capture an adjacent square by changing to that color
the captured square will join your blob change color with you
!F [color] to change to a color
!F new for a new game
player one starts at the bottom left & player two at the top right
you cannot change to the color you are already or the other player's color

If anyone is interested (of the two people who've read this project) you should feel free to use the code for anything you want
I'd love to see whatever you make from it though!

Also in contributors "CurrentTV" is me, I used a fake email address (as in completely fabricated) when I set up git so gitHub thought I was "CurrentTV".
Anyway, now I fixed the email address in Git, so it's cool.
