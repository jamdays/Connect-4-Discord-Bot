# Connect-4-Discord-Bot
this is a discord bot I made that facilitates connect four games between discord users
It can also play othello and mancala, but mancala isn't very good because it is just numbers. 
It only can have one instance of each game at a time. For example, only one game of connect 4 will exist at a time. 
!help for help-- but this is the message it will display. 
 "!board - display board \n" +
                    "!play *col* - play the col specified (1-7)" +
                    "\n !Mplay *spot* - play the beads in specified spot on your side (1-6) \n " +
                    "!Mreset - reset mancala board \n" +
                    "OTHELLO\n" +
                    "!O start new - start a new game of othello\n" +
                    "!O play *row, col* - play piece (if legal) at specified row and column (0,0 - 7,7)")
